# Horiseon-Challenge

## Description

My motivation for my portfolio was to diplay the projects i will work on throughout this class, as well as building a home page from scratch using html and css. I built this project to show future employers my skill set and have them get to know me and my work. I learned how to build a style sheet and html from scratch while adding my own style to it.
